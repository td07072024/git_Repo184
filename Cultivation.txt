Flax is native to the region extending from the eastern Mediterranean to India and was first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent.[7] The soils most suitable for flax, besides the alluvial kind, are deep loams containing a large proportion of organic matter.[8] Flax is often found growing just above the waterline in cranberry bogs. Heavy clays are unsuitable, as are soils of a gravelly or dry sandy nature. Farming flax requires few fertilizers or pesticides. Within eight weeks of sowing, the plant can reach 10–15 cm (4–6 in) in height, reaching 70–80 cm (28–31 in) within 50 days.[citation needed]

History

Flax being harvested during World War I
The earliest evidence of humans using wild flax as a textile comes from the present-day Republic of Georgia, where spun, dyed, and knotted wild flax fibers found in Dzudzuana Cave date to the Upper Paleolithic, 30,000 years ago.[9][10][11] Humans first domesticated flax in the Fertile Crescent region.[12] Evidence exists of a domesticated oilseed flax with increased seed-size from Tell Ramad in Syria[12] and flax fabric fragments from Çatalhöyük in Turkey[13] by c. 9,000 years ago. Use of the crop steadily spread, reaching as far as Switzerland and Germany by 5,000 years ago.[14] In China and India, domesticated flax was cultivated at least 5,000 years ago.[15]

Flax was cultivated extensively in ancient Egypt, where the temple walls had paintings of flowering flax, and mummies were embalmed using linen.[16] Egyptian priests wore only linen, as flax symbolized purity.[17] Phoenicians traded Egyptian linen throughout the Mediterranean and the Romans used it for their sails.[18] As the Roman Empire declined, so did flax production. But with laws designed to publicize the hygiene of linen textiles and the health of linseed oil, Charlemagne revived the crop in the eighth century CE.[19] Eventually, Flanders became the major center of the European linen industry in the Middle Ages.[19] In North America, colonists introduced flax, and it flourished there,[15] but by the early 20th century, cheap cotton and rising farm wages had caused production of flax to become concentrated in northern Russia, which came to provide 90% of the world's output. Since then, flax has lost its importance as a commercial crop, due to the easy availability of more inexpensive synthetic fibres.[20]

In 2022, world production of raw or retted flax was 875,995 tonnes, led by France with 75% of the total.[21] One of the largest regions in France for flax production is Normandy with nearly one-third of the world's production.
