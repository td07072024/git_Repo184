Several other species in the genus Linum are similar in appearance to L. usitatissimum, cultivated flax, including some that have similar blue flowers, and others with white, yellow, or red flowers.[5] Some of these are perennial plants, unlike L. usitatissimum, which is an annual plant.

Cultivated flax plants grow to 1.2 m (4 ft) tall, with slender stems. The leaves are glaucous green, slender lanceolate, 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) long, and 3 mm broad.[6]

The flowers are 15–25 mm in diameter with five petals, which can be coloured white, blue, yellow, and red depending on the species.[6] The fruit is a round, dry capsule 5–9 mm in diameter, containing several glossy brown seeds shaped like apple pips, 4–7 mm long.
